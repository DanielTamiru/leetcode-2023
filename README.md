# 2023 Leetcode Practice
After applying to jobs and writing open assessments throughout 2022, it became abundantly clear that all the coding problem experinece I have to date is not enough to meet the standards of top software recruiters. While I have spent plenty of time on leetcode, I still struggle with more difficult problems, especially dynamic programming ones.

This repo is a place for me to post my solutions and track my progress over the course of 2023. The goal is to solve at least 2 problems a week until the end of the summer and/or I land my last internship.
